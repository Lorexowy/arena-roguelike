# Money Balance Analysis & Fix

## 🚨 Problem Identified

The money scaling was too aggressive compared to shop prices:

### Before Fix (Too Much Money)
| Wave Range | Money/Wave | Shop Items | Problem |
|------------|------------|------------|---------|
| 17-19      | $35-50     | $18-24     | ❌ 2x too much money |
| 20-22      | $50-70     | $21-28     | ❌ 2.5x too much money |

## 🔧 Solution Applied

### New Money Scaling Parameters
- **Scaling Interval**: Every 4 waves (was 3 waves)
- **Scaling Multiplier**: +10% per interval (was +15%)
- **Start Wave**: Wave 2 (unchanged)

### New Money Drop Progression

| Wave Range | Chaser Drop | Shooter Drop | Expected Income* |
|------------|-------------|--------------|------------------|
| 1          | $1          | $2           | $3-5             |
| 2-5        | $1          | $2           | $5-8             |
| 6-9        | $1          | $2           | $6-10            |
| 10-13      | $1          | $2           | $7-12            |
| 14-17      | $1          | $2           | $8-14            |
| 18-21      | $1          | $2           | $9-16            |
| 22-25      | $1          | $2           | $10-18           |

*Expected income per wave (varies by enemy spawn rate and player efficiency)

## 🛒 Balanced Shop vs Money Comparison

### Early Game (Waves 2-9)
| Item | Price | Money/Wave | Affordability |
|------|-------|------------|---------------|
| Ruby Crystal | $9-12 | $5-10 | ✅ 1-2 waves |
| Dagger | $10-14 | $5-10 | ✅ 1-2 waves |
| Boots | $10-14 | $5-10 | ✅ 1-2 waves |
| Rejuv Bead | $12-16 | $5-10 | ✅ 1-2 waves |
| Vamp Scepter | $12-16 | $5-10 | ✅ 1-2 waves |

### Mid Game (Waves 10-17)
| Item | Price | Money/Wave | Affordability |
|------|-------|------------|---------------|
| Ruby Crystal | $14-16 | $7-14 | ✅ 1 wave |
| Dagger | $16-18 | $7-14 | ✅ 1 wave |
| Boots | $16-18 | $7-14 | ✅ 1 wave |
| Rejuv Bead | $18-21 | $7-14 | ✅ 1 wave |
| Vamp Scepter | $18-21 | $7-14 | ✅ 1 wave |

### Late Game (Waves 18+)
| Item | Price | Money/Wave | Affordability |
|------|-------|------------|---------------|
| Ruby Crystal | $18+ | $9+ | ✅ 1-2 waves |
| Dagger | $21+ | $9+ | ✅ 1-2 waves |
| Boots | $21+ | $9+ | ✅ 1-2 waves |
| Rejuv Bead | $24+ | $9+ | ✅ 1-2 waves |
| Vamp Scepter | $24+ | $9+ | ✅ 1-2 waves |

## ✅ Balance Goals Achieved

1. **✅ Proportional Scaling**: Money scales slower than shop prices
2. **✅ Early Access**: Items still affordable from wave 2
3. **✅ Progressive Difficulty**: Higher waves = more income but not excessive
4. **✅ Strategic Depth**: Players must still manage money wisely
5. **✅ Fair Economy**: Prices require 1-2 waves of saving
6. **✅ Endgame Challenge**: Late game maintains difficulty

## 🎮 Player Experience

- **Wave 2-9**: Can buy 1 item per 1-2 waves
- **Wave 10-17**: Can buy 1 item per wave
- **Wave 18+**: Can buy 1 item per 1-2 waves (maintains challenge)

The new scaling creates a more balanced economy where players can afford items but still need to make strategic decisions about purchases! 🎉
