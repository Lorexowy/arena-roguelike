- **Pity System**: +5% chance added after each failed appearance
- **Guaranteed Appearance**: Shop guaranteed to appear within 4 breaks
- **Reset**: Pity counter resets on successful appearance

### 2. Shop Catalog (`lib/game/shop/catalog.ts`)
Data-driven catalog system with placeholder entries:

#### Perks (Tiered Upgrades)
- **Crit Chance I/II/III**: +5%/+8%/+12% crit chance
- **Power I/II/III**: +15%/+20%/+30% damage

Each entry includes:
- ID, name, description
- Rarity tier (common/uncommon/rare/epic)
- Base cost
- Availability condition function
- Effect application function

### 3. Shop Logic System (`lib/game/shop/logic.ts`)

#### Configuration Constants
```typescript
BASE_CHANCE: 0.25              // 25% base chance
PITY_INCREMENT: 0.05           // +5% per failed attempt
GUARANTEED_AFTER: 4            // Guarantee after 4 breaks
MIN_WAVE: 2                    // Start from wave 2
OFFER_SIZE: 3                  // Always 3 cards per offer
MIN_PERKS: 1                   // Minimum 1 perk per offer
MIN_ITEMS: 1                   // Minimum 1 item per offer
PURCHASE_LIMIT: 1              // 1 purchase per visit
BASE_REROLL_COST: 5            // First reroll: $5
REROLL_COST_INCREMENT: 5       // +$5 per additional reroll
PRICE_SCALING_WAVES: 2         // Scale every 2 waves
PRICE_SCALING_MULTIPLIER: 1.08 // +8% per interval
```

#### Key Functions
- `shouldShopAppear()`: Determines if shop appears this break
- `updateShopAppearance()`: Updates pity system
- `generateShopOffer()`: Creates weighted random offer
- `calculatePrice()`: Scales prices with wave number
- `rerollShop()`: Rerolls offer (costs money)
- `purchaseShopItem()`: Handles purchases and applies effects

### 4. Shop Modal Component (`components/game/ShopModal.tsx`)

#### UI Features
- **Header**: Shows current money and shop title
- **Cards**: Display exactly 3 purchasable items (min 1 perk + 1 item)
  - Rarity-colored labels
  - Name, type (perk/item), description
  - Price (red if unaffordable)
  - Card number (1-3) for keyboard shortcuts
- **Action Buttons**:
  - Reroll button (shows cost)
  - Close shop button
- **Purchase Notice**: Shows when purchase limit reached

#### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `1-3`: Purchase corresponding card
- `R`: Reroll offer
- `ESC`: Close shop

#### Visual Design
- Brown/tan merchant theme with gold accents
- Rarity-based color coding:
  - Common: Gray
  - Uncommon: Green
  - Rare: Blue
  - Epic: Purple
- Hover effects and animations
- Disabled states when unaffordable or limit reached

### 5. Integration with Game Systems

#### Wave System Updates (`lib/game/systems/waves.ts`)
- Added shop state tracking to `WaveState`:
  - `shopAppearanceChance`
  - `breaksSinceLastShop`
  - `shopAvailable`
  - `shopBannerShown`
- Initialization and reset logic included

#### GameCanvas Integration (`components/game/GameCanvas.tsx`)
- Shop appearance check during countdown state
- Pause/resume system integration (preserves break timer)
- Window API for shop interactions:
  - `arenaOpenShop()`
  - `arenaCloseShop()`
  - `arenaShopPurchase(entryId)`
  - `arenaShopReroll()`
  - `arenaGetShopState()`
  - `arenaShopAvailable()`
- React state management for shop modal and banner
- Auto-close after purchase (500ms delay for feedback)

### 6. Shop Banner
Appears when shop is available during wave break:
- "🏪 Merchant has arrived!" message
- "Open Shop" button
- Animated slide-down entrance
- Dismisses when shop is opened

### 7. Shop Offer Structure

#### Random Composition
- **Always 3 cards per visit**:
  - Minimum 1 perk (stackable upgrade)
  - Minimum 1 item (unique passive)
  - 3rd card randomly chosen from remaining entries
- Weighted random selection based on rarity
- Cards shuffled for variety
- No duplicates within a single offer

### 8. Purchase Mechanics

#### Money System
- Players earn money from enemy kills (existing system)
- Money is displayed in shop header
- Cards show if player can't afford (red price)
- Money deducted immediately on purchase

#### Purchase Flow
1. Player clicks card or presses number key (1-3)
2. Check if affordable and within purchase limit
3. Deduct money from player
4. Apply effect immediately to player stats
5. Show success feedback
6. Auto-close shop after 500ms

#### Purchase Limit
- **1 purchase per shop visit** (configurable)
- After purchase, cards become disabled
- Success notice appears
- Player must close shop to continue

### 9. Reroll System
- **First reroll**: $5
- **Each additional reroll**: +$5 (cumulative: $5, $10, $15...)
- Generates new random offer based on rarity weights
- Disabled if player can't afford
- Resets when shop closes

### 10. Price Scaling
Dynamic pricing based on wave progression:
- Base cost defined per item
- Every 2 waves: apply +8% multiplier
- Formula: `baseCost × (1.08 ^ intervals)`
- Examples:
  - Wave 2: Base cost
  - Wave 4: Base × 1.08
  - Wave 6: Base × 1.1664
  - Wave 10: Base × 1.3605

### 11. Rarity System
Weighted random selection for shop offers:
- **Common**: 50% weight
- **Uncommon**: 30% weight
- **Rare**: 15% weight
- **Epic**: 5% weight

Higher rarity items are more powerful but less likely to appear.

## How to Extend the Shop

### Adding New Items

1. Open `lib/game/shop/catalog.ts`
2. Add entry to `SHOP_CATALOG` array:

```typescript
{
  id: 'my_item',
  type: 'item', // or 'perk'
  name: 'Item Name',
  description: 'What it does',
  rarity: 'rare',
  baseCost: 25,
  isAvailable: (player, upgradeCount) => {
    // Return true if should appear in shop
    return true;
  },
  apply: (player, upgradeCount) => {
    // Apply effect to player
    player.damageMultiplier *= 1.5;
  },
}
```

### Adjusting Shop Configuration

Edit constants in `lib/game/shop/logic.ts`:
```typescript
export const SHOP_CONFIG = {
  BASE_CHANCE: 0.25,           // Appearance chance
  PITY_INCREMENT: 0.15,        // Pity gain per miss
  GUARANTEED_AFTER: 4,         // Max breaks before guarantee
  PURCHASE_LIMIT: 1,           // Purchases per visit
  BASE_REROLL_COST: 5,         // First reroll cost
  REROLL_COST_INCREMENT: 5,    // Cost increase
  PRICE_SCALING_MULTIPLIER: 1.08, // Price scaling
  // ... more constants
};
```

### Changing Rarity Weights

Edit `getRarityWeight()` in `lib/game/shop/catalog.ts`:
```typescript
export function getRarityWeight(rarity: ShopRarity): number {
  switch (rarity) {
    case 'common': return 50;    // Adjust these
    case 'uncommon': return 30;
    case 'rare': return 15;
    case 'epic': return 5;
  }
}
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Appearance Logic**: Play through multiple wave breaks to verify shop appears with correct frequency
2. **Pity System**: Intentionally wait for 4+ breaks to test guaranteed appearance
3. **Purchases**: Test buying each placeholder item to verify effects apply
4. **Rerolls**: Test multiple rerolls to verify cost increases correctly
5. **Money**: Test purchases when broke to verify disabled state
6. **Keyboard**: Test all shortcuts (1-3, R, ESC)
7. **Price Scaling**: Progress to high waves to verify prices increase
8. **Modal Behavior**: Test opening/closing shop during different game states
9. **Timer Preservation**: Verify wave break timer continues correctly after shop closes
10. **Game Restart**: Verify shop state resets on game restart

## Notes

- All placeholder items are functional and demonstrate the system
- The catalog is designed to be easily replaced with real items
- Shop appearance uses proper random number generation with pity tracking
- Shop integrates cleanly with existing pause/modal system
- No modifications to core game mechanics (XP, waves, enemies, etc.)
- Shop banner auto-dismisses when opened
- Purchase limit prevents overpowered runs from single shop visit
- Price scaling ensures items remain relevant at higher waves
