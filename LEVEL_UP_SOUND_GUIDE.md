# Level Up Sound Guide

## ðŸŽµ New Sound Added!

The game now plays a sound effect when you level up! This makes the progression feel more rewarding and satisfying.

## ðŸ”Š Sound Details

### **Level Up Sound**
- **Trigger**: Every time you gain enough XP to level up
- **Volume**: 60% (higher than shoot sound for special event)
- **File**: `public/sounds/level_up.mp3`
- **Timing**: Plays immediately when level up occurs

### **Integration**
- âœ… **Automatic**: Plays every time you level up
- âœ… **No Setup**: Works out of the box
- âœ… **Volume Control**: Respects your master volume setting
- âœ… **Performance**: Preloaded for instant playback

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works

### **Level Up Flow**
1. **Collect XP**: Kill enemies to get XP orbs
2. **Reach Threshold**: XP bar fills up to next level
3. **Level Up**: Player level increases
4. **Sound Plays**: `playLevelUpSound()` is called automatically
5. **Modal Shows**: Level up screen appears with upgrade choices

### **Technical Integration**
```typescript
// In player.ts - addXP function
if (player.xp >= player.xpToNextLevel) {
  player.level++;
  player.xp = 0;
  player.xpToNextLevel = LEVEL_CONFIG.xpPerLevel(player.level);
  
  // Play level up sound
  playLevelUpSound();
  
  return true; // Level up occurred
}
```

## ðŸŽ® User Experience

### **Before (No Sound)**

- Less satisfying progression

### **After (With Sound)**
- âœ… **Audio Feedback**: Immediate sound confirmation
- âœ… **Satisfaction**: Makes leveling feel rewarding
- âœ… **Consistency**: Matches other game sounds
- âœ… **Volume Control**: Respects player preferences
