## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

### Scaling Formula
```typescript
const intervals = Math.floor((currentWave - 2) / 3);
const multiplier = Math.pow(1.15, intervals);
const price = Math.ceil(baseCost * multiplier);
```

### Configuration
```typescript
PRICE_SCALING_WAVES: 3,         // Every 3 waves
PRICE_SCALING_MULTIPLIER: 1.15, // +15% per interval
```

## âœ… Balance Goals Achieved

1. **Early Game Access**: Items affordable from wave 2
2. **Progressive Scaling**: Prices grow with game difficulty
3. **Strategic Depth**: Players must manage money wisely
